## M5 post/comment moderation — candidate awaiting local acceptance gate

Verified implementation base:

`b498c67f12cadb1e227433d1e529bdc57aee99a2`

Implementation branch:

`astra/m5-post-comment-moderation`

Exact executable candidate:

`baeed61e7c3684a4b973937ee56aa47f73be93c9`

Implementation boundary:

- moderator/admin-only idempotent post and comment hide mutations;
- PostgreSQL-authoritative authorization using immutable numeric `users.id`;
- new moderation audit fields record first moderation time and moderator numeric user ID while existing `deleted_at` remains the visibility/tombstone primitive;
- one atomic PostgreSQL mutation statement per target returns authoritative resulting state without a reconciliation read;
- post moderation reuses existing feed/search/around/profile public visibility predicates;
- comment moderation preserves the existing structural tombstone model so descendants remain accessible and new replies to a moderated parent are rejected;
- selected-post frontend moderation state stays local, abortable and epoch/selection-fenced;
- moderated retained post rows stay in board layout as disabled hidden placeholders until normal bounded window replacement removes them; board-wide/global state machinery was not added;
- restore/unmoderate, imports/jobs/admin observability, private messages and unrelated production-hardening work remain deferred.

Validation already completed:

- server/PostgreSQL CI on backend candidate `ec9d6b75100c0612f424da57c492067cd4e9793c`: `v2 CI` run `37532689068`, attempt 2, job `112507601335`, **success**;
- moderation tests cover moderator/admin authorization, ordinary-user rejection, signed-out/same-origin HTTP boundaries, missing targets, repeated/idempotent mutation, concurrent post moderation, authoritative state, immediate feed/around invisibility, structural comment tombstones and rejected replies to moderated parents;
- committed PostgreSQL tests execute `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` against 5,000-row disposable post/comment fixtures and require primary-key-backed target access with no large-relation sequential scan, external merge or disk spill;
- the same server gate passed retained Go/PostgreSQL and Rust worker correctness plus tracked-checkout cleanliness;
- frontend CI logs on exact final candidate `baeed61e7c3684a4b973937ee56aa47f73be93c9` show 37/37 Node tests, `tsc --noEmit`, Vite production build, worker-build applicability check and clean tracked checkout all passing, with `v2-ci: PASS`;
- GitHub nevertheless records fresh run `37533816318`, job `112509565110`, as `failure` despite every named workflow step being `success` and the logs containing no application/test failure. This is treated as a CI status-reporting infrastructure blocker, not as green CI.

The user explicitly authorized proceeding with the local validation handoff despite that CI status-reporting blocker, and explicitly authorized creation, mutation and deletion of an isolated disposable PostgreSQL database for this gate only.

Acceptance/integration decision: **not yet accepted and not integrated**. The candidate must remain off `v2` until the returned local gate evidence is inspected and accepted here.

`deabd4abede53b30e9d4205e8cb5454c30c3563753243dbd1c5e4ec577a6dd98`

Archive integrity passed with 40 retained files. Raw API/database evidence, committed EXPLAIN output, real-browser assertions/traces, stale-response ordering, CI metadata and cleanup findings were inspected.

### Consolidated gate facts

- Isolated PostgreSQL 16.15 applied migrations `001` through `006` and used the committed 100,000-post / 1,000-user / 100,000-media / 300,000-post-tag fixture plus committed vote/comment seeds and gate-specific disposable rows.
- Invitation-only registration, login, immutable numeric session identity, session continuity and logout invalidation were exercised. Signed-out auth and mutation boundaries returned the expected 401 responses.
- Public feed IDs were descending and unique; direct around-post reconstruction and included-tag, excluded-tag and numeric-predicate search all succeeded.
- Authenticated post voting, nested comment read/create, comment voting, tag add, ordinary-user tag-removal rejection, moderator tag removal and repeated idempotent removal all matched authoritative PostgreSQL state.
- Public profiles returned only the accepted `id` / `username` / `createdAt` metadata and two 33-post cursor pages with descending unique IDs and zero overlap.
- The primary real-Chromium scenario preserved board selection placement, same-row/cross-row navigation, canonical post routes, Back/Forward, Arrow/J/K navigation, search canonicality, mutation update scope, profile navigation and return-to-board invariants.
- Initial browser checks for nested-comment proof, comment score text and profile ordering contained gate-script selector/type mistakes. Follow-up evidence established nested depth-1 replies and reply creation, authoritative comment score/vote `1` with the intended upvote pressed and tree intact, and integer-descending profile IDs. These were harness defects, not application defects.
- A delayed real tag response for post 99996 was released after selection moved to 99992; selection remained 99992, the tag panel remained fenced to 99992 and application invariants stayed clean. The observed `ERR_ABORTED` was the intended cancellation.
- Main/follow-up/moderator browser runs recorded zero failed requests; representative real AVIF media was served by the isolated nginx fixture. The stale test's console 401 was the expected signed-out `/auth/me` probe.
- `PerformanceObserver(type=longtask)` observed **0 Long Tasks** across representative warmed board, mutation, comment/tag and profile interactions. Final retained board state was **120 posts**, below the established **960-post** bound, with `assertInvariants()` clean.
- Candidate hot SQL remained bounded/index-backed. The only sequential scans were the 100-row `tags` dimension, sorts were bounded in-memory quicksorts, and no temp spill was observed. Current feed/search/vote/comment/profile/auth shapes in the committed fixtures remained sub-millisecond on this gate host.
- `explain_compare.sql` also intentionally retains a historical comparison shape whose older-cursor media merge scanned about 50,077 media rows and took **4.507 ms**; its bounded counterpart in the same fixture took **0.059 ms**. This comparison baseline is not the active candidate query shape and is retained here to avoid mischaracterizing every plan in the archive as sub-millisecond.
- No application-level N+1 pattern, large-relation sequential scan, unbounded sort, pool/transaction deviation or concrete cross-slice regression was found.
- The M4 requirement review matched `PLAN.md`: auth/invite registration, connected board, filters/search, votes, tags, nested comments and profiles were all exercised. **No concrete unimplemented M4 requirement was found.**
- Cleanup findings record the disposable database dropped, temporary API/nginx processes stopped, detached gate worktree removed/pruned, unrelated services untouched and canonical tracked status clean.

Decision: **accept the consolidated M4 connected-core milestone gate and close M4**. The integrated product preserves the accepted correctness, authorization, navigation, bounded-state, stale-response and representative browser-performance invariants. No cache, index, schema, global-store, virtualization or other architecture change is justified by this gate.

## M4 profiles — accepted and integrated

Verified live GitHub `v2` base before integration:

`ae42dc67afc4885196e9580dad79ec83ea66befd`

Implementation branch:

`astra/m4-profiles`

Exact executable candidate:

`6fb51b6c11891f7ab47d071d8964ed1bd83f94d2`

Exact-candidate `v2 CI` run `37429479017`, job `112156704423`: **success**.

- exact SHA checkout/verification passed;
- scoped v2 correctness gate passed;
- target-worker release-build verification passed;
- tracked checkout remained unchanged.

### Accepted implementation boundary

- Canonical public profile route is `/user/:id` and uses immutable numeric `users.id`.
- Public API is `GET /api/v2/users/:id`.
- Public user metadata is limited to numeric `id`, current `username`, and `createdAt`.
- Profile posts use post-ID descending cursor pagination with default page size 33 and maximum 120; no OFFSET pagination.
- Public profile posts expose only rows authored by that user that are released, nondeleted, SFW, and have ready media.
- Profile SQL reuses the existing signed-out post projection/ready-media boundary; no role, credential, invitation, moderation, messaging, comment-history, profile-edit, bio, avatar, display-name, or username-rename surface was added.
- Frontend profile state is page-local. Requests are abortable and sequence-fenced; delayed responses cannot update an unmounted/newer document state.
- `Load more` merges by immutable post ID, keeps descending ordering, and avoids duplicates.
- Clicking a profile thumbnail uses canonical `/post/:id`; browser Back reconstructs the profile coherently.
- No schema migration, Redis dependency, cache, new global store, virtualization, event stream, or speculative index was added.

### Accepted PostgreSQL/API/browser gate

Evidence package:

`m4-profile-20261006T131014Z.zip`

Independently verified SHA-256:

`eb0448412ad3bdca1eb3738dbe8805885ab7cb163ee138c01ff4b701b9bdf146`

Archive integrity passed. Raw PostgreSQL plans, API request/response/state evidence, browser assertions/request ordering, Playwright traces, CI metadata, long-task observations, and cleanup evidence were inspected.

The disposable PostgreSQL 16.15 fixture applied migrations `001` through `006` and contained 1,000 users, 100,000 posts, 100,000 media rows and the committed benchmark tag relations before gate-specific profile rows.

`EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` evidence:

- active user lookup used `users_pkey`, returned one row, no rows removed, shared-hit buffers 6, planning 0.173 ms, execution 0.038 ms;
- committed seed-only first profile page used `posts_author_idx` plus `media_pkey`, returned zero eligible rows after filtering 100 user rows, no sort/temp spill, planning 0.219 ms, execution 0.195 ms;
- committed seed-only older-cursor page used the same indexes with `id < 50000`, filtered 50 rows, no sort/temp spill, planning 0.081 ms, execution 0.037 ms;
- supplemental populated first page returned 34 rows through `posts_author_idx` + `media_pkey`, shared-hit buffers 109, no sort/temp spill, planning 0.287 ms, execution 0.082 ms;
- supplemental populated older-cursor shape returned 7 rows after scanning/filtering 104 ineligible author rows and one non-ready media row, shared-hit buffers 131, no sort/temp spill, planning 0.093 ms, execution 0.226 ms;
- supplemental seeded-SFW user shape returned 34 rows, shared-hit buffers 139, no sort/temp spill, planning 0.055 ms, execution 0.174 ms.

There was no sequential scan over a large relation, no explicit sort node, no temp-file spill, and no application-level N+1 pattern. The profile request performs a fixed public-user lookup plus one bounded/index-backed post-page query. The older-cursor populated plan demonstrates predicate filtering can inspect more author rows than it returns, but measured work remained small at the 100,000-post fixture and does not justify a new partial index without evidence from a materially worse real query distribution.

Live API evidence on the same fixture established:

- signed-out `GET /api/v2/users/500?limit=33` returned 200 with exactly `[createdAt, id, username]` user metadata;
- page 1 contained 33 descending unique post IDs and `nextBefore=100094`;
- the next cursor page contained 7 descending unique IDs, zero overlap, preserved cross-page descending order, and exhausted the 40 eligible gate rows;
- controlled NSFW/non-SFW, unreleased, deleted, not-ready, and other-author posts were all excluded;
- `/api/v2/users/1001` returned the intended 404 `user_not_found` response.

Real-browser evidence:

- primary profile scenario: **17/17 assertions passed**;
- stale-response scenario: **8/8 assertions passed**;
- direct `/user/500` rendered `bench-user-500`, numeric ID and member-since metadata;
- initial grid contained exactly 33 descending unique posts;
- `Load more` produced 40 descending unique posts without duplicates/reordering and hid when exhausted;
- thumbnail navigation reached canonical `/post/100126`; Back returned coherently to `/user/500`;
- `/user/1001` rendered the intended not-found state;
- delayed real `/api/v2/users/500` delivery after leaving the profile could not change the newer `/` document or leak user-500 state into a subsequent `/user/501` document;
- `PerformanceObserver(type=longtask)` recorded 0 long tasks for both the initial profile render and warmed pagination interaction;
- browser runs recorded 0 page errors and 0 transport-level failed requests.

The console contained HTTP error messages only for the isolated fixture's intentionally absent media bytes (`*.thumb.avif`/full media paths) plus the existing expected signed-out `/api/v2/auth/me` 401 on board navigation. These were cross-checked against request/nginx evidence and are test-harness/existing-auth artifacts, not profile-code errors. No acceptance decision is based on the missing fixture media bytes.

Cleanup evidence established that the temporary API/nginx processes were terminated, disposable database `m4prof_20261006t131014z` was dropped and verified absent, the detached gate worktree was removed/pruned, and the canonical tracked checkout remained clean. No prohibited production/shared persistent-state write occurred.

Decision: **accept M4 public read-only profiles**. The slice satisfies the intended numeric-identity/public-metadata boundary, bounded cursor paging, visibility filters, canonical navigation, stale-response isolation, and measured SQL/browser behavior. Existing indexes are sufficient for the measured query shapes. No new index, cache, schema change, global profile store, polling layer, or virtualization change is justified by this evidence.

### Integration verification

## Retained M4 board/auth/search decisions

- session identity is immutable numeric `users.id`; usernames are never relational authorization identity;
- invitation, identity and credentials remain separate for later OAuth/OIDC/passkey/email expansion;
- PostgreSQL-backed opaque sessions remain the baseline; no JWT/Redis auth cache;
- board root uses post-ID cursor feed; direct post reconstruction uses bounded around queries without an unnecessary initial feed;
- search `q` is canonical across root/post routes and carried through feed pagination and around reconstruction;
- selected-post shell updates immediately before network work;
- route, ephemeral UI and retained server state remain separate;
- feed pages remain bounded and retained board state is capped at 960 posts before considering virtualization;
- stable row identity, viewport-anchor correction and targeted retained-post mutation remain required;
- selected-post media-status polling remains bounded and abortable;
- nginx exposes processed media only, not ingestion sources;
- the isolated non-default-port nginx auth caveat remains: `$host` omits an explicit non-default port, while production default-port HTTPS is unaffected.

## Retained architecture / invariants

- nginx for TLS/static frontend/media/reverse proxy;
- SolidJS + TypeScript + Vite + plain CSS;
- Go + standard `net/http` + pgx/v5;
- PostgreSQL authoritative for application state and durable jobs;
- no Redis baseline dependency without measured need;
- Rust media worker + local NVMe media storage;
- immutable numeric relational IDs; never username as a foreign key;
- post-ID cursor pagination, never OFFSET;
- real search lexer/parser/AST and parameterized SQL only;
- selected-post UI updates immediately and never waits for network;
- bounded 960-post board retention before virtualization;
- stable row identity and targeted retained-post updates;
- hot SQL bounded/indexed for actual query shapes and checked with `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` when changed;
- filesystem/codec work stays outside DB transactions;
- media worker concurrency remains explicitly bounded.

## Deferred work

Do not pull these into the next task without a concrete requirement:

- broader video transcoding or exact WebM/EBML acceptance;
- media orphan/janitor hardening;
- deployment UID/GID/media-storage permissions;
- stronger filesystem hardening if the media-tree threat model changes;
- auth abuse/rate limits and KDF admission controls before production-hardening evidence requires them;
- virtualization, Redis synchronization, event streams or a large frontend store;
- v1-v2 end-to-end speedup claims before an apples-to-apples benchmark exists;
- profile edit/bio/avatar/display-name/rename functionality until a later explicit product slice requires it.

## Unresolved issues

No unresolved correctness, SQL-plan, browser-performance, integration or architecture blocker remains from M4 after the accepted consolidated milestone gate.

The profile older-cursor plan can inspect filtered author rows before finding an eligible SFW/ready row. Current 100,000-post evidence remains small and index-backed; do not add a partial profile index without a real distribution/latency signal that justifies it.

The profile browser gate's media 404 console messages came from benchmark storage keys without corresponding media files in the disposable nginx tree. This did not affect profile route/API/state assertions and is not a candidate defect, but future consolidated browser gates should use real served fixture media when practical so console-noise checks are cleaner.

## Single best next task

Inspect the returned local-agent evidence for exact candidate `baeed61e7c3684a4b973937ee56aa47f73be93c9`, decide acceptance of the first M5 post/comment moderation slice, and only if accepted fast-forward it into current `v2`, verify post-integration CI, and update this state before starting another M5 slice.
