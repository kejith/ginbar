## M4 profiles — accepted and integrated

Verified live GitHub `v2` base before integration:

`ae42dc67afc4885196e9580dad79ec83ea66befd`

Implementation branch:

`astra/m4-profiles`

Exact executable candidate:

`6fb51b6c11891f7ab47d071d8964ed1bd83f94d2`

Exact-candidate `v2 CI` run `37429479017`, job `112156704423`: **success**.

- exact SHA checkout/verification passed;
- scoped v2 correctness gate passed;
- target-worker release-build verification passed;
- tracked checkout remained unchanged.

### Accepted implementation boundary

- Canonical public profile route is `/user/:id` and uses immutable numeric `users.id`.
- Public API is `GET /api/v2/users/:id`.
- Public user metadata is limited to numeric `id`, current `username`, and `createdAt`.
- Profile posts use post-ID descending cursor pagination with default page size 33 and maximum 120; no OFFSET pagination.
- Public profile posts expose only rows authored by that user that are released, nondeleted, SFW, and have ready media.
- Profile SQL reuses the existing signed-out post projection/ready-media boundary; no role, credential, invitation, moderation, messaging, comment-history, profile-edit, bio, avatar, display-name, or username-rename surface was added.
- Frontend profile state is page-local. Requests are abortable and sequence-fenced; delayed responses cannot update an unmounted/newer document state.
- `Load more` merges by immutable post ID, keeps descending ordering, and avoids duplicates.
- Clicking a profile thumbnail uses canonical `/post/:id`; browser Back reconstructs the profile coherently.
- No schema migration, Redis dependency, cache, new global store, virtualization, event stream, or speculative index was added.

### Accepted PostgreSQL/API/browser gate

Evidence package:

`m4-profile-20261006T131014Z.zip`

Independently verified SHA-256:

`eb0448412ad3bdca1eb3738dbe8805885ab7cb163ee138c01ff4b701b9bdf146`

Archive integrity passed. Raw PostgreSQL plans, API request/response/state evidence, browser assertions/request ordering, Playwright traces, CI metadata, long-task observations, and cleanup evidence were inspected.

The disposable PostgreSQL 16.15 fixture applied migrations `001` through `006` and contained 1,000 users, 100,000 posts, 100,000 media rows and the committed benchmark tag relations before gate-specific profile rows.

`EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` evidence:

- active user lookup used `users_pkey`, returned one row, no rows removed, shared-hit buffers 6, planning 0.173 ms, execution 0.038 ms;
- committed seed-only first profile page used `posts_author_idx` plus `media_pkey`, returned zero eligible rows after filtering 100 user rows, no sort/temp spill, planning 0.219 ms, execution 0.195 ms;
- committed seed-only older-cursor page used the same indexes with `id < 50000`, filtered 50 rows, no sort/temp spill, planning 0.081 ms, execution 0.037 ms;
- supplemental populated first page returned 34 rows through `posts_author_idx` + `media_pkey`, shared-hit buffers 109, no sort/temp spill, planning 0.287 ms, execution 0.082 ms;
- supplemental populated older-cursor shape returned 7 rows after scanning/filtering 104 ineligible author rows and one non-ready media row, shared-hit buffers 131, no sort/temp spill, planning 0.093 ms, execution 0.226 ms;
- supplemental seeded-SFW user shape returned 34 rows, shared-hit buffers 139, no sort/temp spill, planning 0.055 ms, execution 0.174 ms.

There was no sequential scan over a large relation, no explicit sort node, no temp-file spill, and no application-level N+1 pattern. The profile request performs a fixed public-user lookup plus one bounded/index-backed post-page query. The older-cursor populated plan demonstrates predicate filtering can inspect more author rows than it returns, but measured work remained small at the 100,000-post fixture and does not justify a new partial index without evidence from a materially worse real query distribution.

Live API evidence on the same fixture established:

- signed-out `GET /api/v2/users/500?limit=33` returned 200 with exactly `[createdAt, id, username]` user metadata;
- page 1 contained 33 descending unique post IDs and `nextBefore=100094`;
- the next cursor page contained 7 descending unique IDs, zero overlap, preserved cross-page descending order, and exhausted the 40 eligible gate rows;
- controlled NSFW/non-SFW, unreleased, deleted, not-ready, and other-author posts were all excluded;
- `/api/v2/users/1001` returned the intended 404 `user_not_found` response.

Real-browser evidence:

- primary profile scenario: **17/17 assertions passed**;
- stale-response scenario: **8/8 assertions passed**;
- direct `/user/500` rendered `bench-user-500`, numeric ID and member-since metadata;
- initial grid contained exactly 33 descending unique posts;
- `Load more` produced 40 descending unique posts without duplicates/reordering and hid when exhausted;
- thumbnail navigation reached canonical `/post/100126`; Back returned coherently to `/user/500`;
- `/user/1001` rendered the intended not-found state;
- delayed real `/api/v2/users/500` delivery after leaving the profile could not change the newer `/` document or leak user-500 state into a subsequent `/user/501` document;
- `PerformanceObserver(type=longtask)` recorded 0 long tasks for both the initial profile render and warmed pagination interaction;
- browser runs recorded 0 page errors and 0 transport-level failed requests.

The console contained HTTP error messages only for the isolated fixture's intentionally absent media bytes (`*.thumb.avif`/full media paths) plus the existing expected signed-out `/api/v2/auth/me` 401 on board navigation. These were cross-checked against request/nginx evidence and are test-harness/existing-auth artifacts, not profile-code errors. No acceptance decision is based on the missing fixture media bytes.

Cleanup evidence established that the temporary API/nginx processes were terminated, disposable database `m4prof_20261006t131014z` was dropped and verified absent, the detached gate worktree was removed/pruned, and the canonical tracked checkout remained clean. No prohibited production/shared persistent-state write occurred.

Decision: **accept M4 public read-only profiles**. The slice satisfies the intended numeric-identity/public-metadata boundary, bounded cursor paging, visibility filters, canonical navigation, stale-response isolation, and measured SQL/browser behavior. Existing indexes are sufficient for the measured query shapes. No new index, cache, schema change, global profile store, polling layer, or virtualization change is justified by this evidence.

### Integration verification

The accepted executable was non-force fast-forwarded on remote `v2`:

`ae42dc67afc4885196e9580dad79ec83ea66befd -> 6fb51b6c11891f7ab47d071d8964ed1bd83f94d2`

The candidate was exactly three commits ahead of the verified base with no divergence. No merge commit or force update was used.

Post-fast-forward `v2 CI` run `37472400920`, job `112298986709`: **success** on exact integrated executable `6fb51b6c11891f7ab47d071d8964ed1bd83f94d2`.

- `head_branch=v2` and `head_sha=6fb51b6c11891f7ab47d071d8964ed1bd83f94d2`;
- exact checkout and SHA verification succeeded;
- scoped v2 correctness gate succeeded;
- target-worker release-build verification succeeded;
- tracked checkout remained unchanged;
- all workflow steps completed successfully.

Integration decision: **profiles are accepted and integrated; the profile slice is closed**.

## Retained M4 board/auth/search decisions

- session identity is immutable numeric `users.id`; usernames are never relational authorization identity;
- invitation, identity and credentials remain separate for later OAuth/OIDC/passkey/email expansion;
- PostgreSQL-backed opaque sessions remain the baseline; no JWT/Redis auth cache;
- board root uses post-ID cursor feed; direct post reconstruction uses bounded around queries without an unnecessary initial feed;
- search `q` is canonical across root/post routes and carried through feed pagination and around reconstruction;
- selected-post shell updates immediately before network work;
- route, ephemeral UI and retained server state remain separate;
- feed pages remain bounded and retained board state is capped at 960 posts before considering virtualization;
- stable row identity, viewport-anchor correction and targeted retained-post mutation remain required;
- selected-post media-status polling remains bounded and abortable;
- nginx exposes processed media only, not ingestion sources;
- the isolated non-default-port nginx auth caveat remains: `$host` omits an explicit non-default port, while production default-port HTTPS is unaffected.

## Retained architecture / invariants

- nginx for TLS/static frontend/media/reverse proxy;
- SolidJS + TypeScript + Vite + plain CSS;
- Go + standard `net/http` + pgx/v5;
- PostgreSQL authoritative for application state and durable jobs;
- no Redis baseline dependency without measured need;
- Rust media worker + local NVMe media storage;
- immutable numeric relational IDs; never username as a foreign key;
- post-ID cursor pagination, never OFFSET;
- real search lexer/parser/AST and parameterized SQL only;
- selected-post UI updates immediately and never waits for network;
- bounded 960-post board retention before virtualization;
- stable row identity and targeted retained-post updates;
- hot SQL bounded/indexed for actual query shapes and checked with `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` when changed;
- filesystem/codec work stays outside DB transactions;
- media worker concurrency remains explicitly bounded.

## Deferred work

Do not pull these into the next task without a concrete requirement:

- broader video transcoding or exact WebM/EBML acceptance;
- media orphan/janitor hardening;
- deployment UID/GID/media-storage permissions;
- stronger filesystem hardening if the media-tree threat model changes;
- auth abuse/rate limits and KDF admission controls before production-hardening evidence requires them;
- virtualization, Redis synchronization, event streams or a large frontend store;
- v1-v2 end-to-end speedup claims before an apples-to-apples benchmark exists;
- profile edit/bio/avatar/display-name/rename functionality until a later explicit product slice requires it.

## Unresolved issues

No unresolved correctness, SQL-plan, browser-performance, integration or architecture blocker remains from the accepted profile, tag-mutation, vote, or comment slices.

The profile older-cursor plan can inspect filtered author rows before finding an eligible SFW/ready row. Current 100,000-post evidence remains small and index-backed; do not add a partial profile index without a real distribution/latency signal that justifies it.

The profile browser gate's media 404 console messages came from benchmark storage keys without corresponding media files in the disposable nginx tree. This did not affect profile route/API/state assertions and is not a candidate defect, but future consolidated browser gates should use real served fixture media when practical so console-noise checks are cleaner.

## Single best next task

Run the consolidated **M4 connected-core milestone gate** from current `v2`: verify the accepted auth/session, board/direct-link/search, post voting, nested comments, comment voting, tag mutations, and public-profile flows together in one real-browser/API/PostgreSQL pass; confirm established board update-scope/navigation/retention invariants and representative long-task behavior still hold; inspect remaining M4 requirements in `PLAN.md` for any actual gap; then either close M4 and begin M5 or address only the concrete blocker found. Do not start M5 before this milestone gate is accepted.
